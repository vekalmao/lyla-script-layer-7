# This is LylaNodes Protection Layer 7 for your sites!



## Setting it up!

### Files
You will have to install lyla-script to use this and in order for this to work. Please Install the script by running
```sh
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vekalmao/lyla-script/main/ddos_lylanodes.sh)
```

### Installing
You then go to the directory ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/ddos-guardian-layer-7`` and download **protection.lua** into it. Run this below to download it:
```sh
curl -Lo protection.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DDOS-Guardian/DDoS-Guardian-Layer-7/main/protection.lua
```

### Editing
After downloading everything, You need to edit a few things! First, there is a variable named "whitelist", You need to add your Server IP (Ex. 184.156.178.1). If you have a IPV4 and IPV6, Do this to allow your server to send all sorts of requests and ignore the firewalls between your server.
```lua
local whitelist = {
    "IP1",
	"IP2"
}
```

Next, Please find this in the code, and change the "SITE-KEY_ to your Cloudflare Key.
```lua
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="SITE-KEY" data-callback="onSubmit"></div>
```

## How to get the cloudflare key?

3. Press "Add Site"

4. Give it a name, Then click "Domains", "Managed", Then select "No" and press "Create". It will give you your Site Key!
